# Simple State Manager

Simple State Manager (SSM for short) is a javascript state manager for responsive websites. It is built to be light weight, has no dependencies (except javascript of course) and aims to be really easy to simply drop into your project ready to use.

As a state manager, SSM allows you to target different javascript towards different states of your site. It allows you to define as many states as your site requires and allows you to have independent Enter, Leave and Resize events for each of the states.

##Getting started

To get started with SSM the first step is to include it in your project, you can do this in two ways

* Download and add the ssm.js (or ssm.min.js) file to your site

### Add States

With Simple State Manager you can add multiple states based on your needs, the
most simple way to add a state is to simply pass the information about your
state to SSM using `ssm.addState`. It is important to remember that the
**width** you provide is the upper limit of your responsive state width, the
lower limit is defined simply by defining another state with a **width** which
is lower.



    ssm.addState({
        id: 'mobile',
        width: 767,
        onEnter: function(){
            console.log('enter mobile')
        }
    });

    ssm.addState({
        width: 1023,
        onEnter: function(){
            console.log('enter tablet')
        }
    });

    ssm.addState({
        width: 9999,
        onEnter: function(){
            console.log('enter desktop')
        }
    });


If you wish to use one command to add multiple states using one command you
can use ssm.addStates to which you should pass an array of states.



    ssm.addStates([
        {
            id: 'mobile',
            width: 767,
            onEnter: function() {
                console.log('enter mobile')
            }
        },
        {
            id: 'tablet',
            width: 1023,
            onEnter: function() {
                console.log('enter tablet')
            }
        },
        {
            id: 'desktop',
            width: 9999,
            onEnter: function() {
                console.log('enter desktop')
            }
        }
    ]);


### Remove States

Sometimes it may be necessary to remove a state, if we have the **id** for the
state we can easily remove the state, to remove the mobile state from our
above example we simply use:



    ssm.removeState('mobile');



Or if you want to remove multiple at the same time

    ssm.removeStates(['tablet', 'mobile']);



### Ready

Once you have finished setting up your states you should run `ssm.ready()`
which will setup the states.



    ssm.ready()


As SSM is chaninable you can even fire the `ssm.ready()` method by simply
adding `.ready()` onto your original command



    ssm.addStates([
        {
            id: 'mobile',
            width: 767,
            onEnter: function() {
                console.log('enter mobile')
            }
        },
        {
            id: 'tablet',
            width: 1023,
            onEnter: function() {
                console.log('enter tablet')
            }
        },
        {
            id: 'desktop',
            width: 9999,
            onEnter: function() {
                console.log('enter desktop')
            }
        }
    ]).ready();


### Debug Mode

To enable the debug mode you simply need to run `ssm.enableDebug()`, this will
add a width meter to the bottom right corner of the viewport area.



    ssm.enableDebug();
